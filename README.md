Biometric Authentication 

This app supports biometric authentication (such as Face ID on iOS and fingerprint on Android) to provide a secure and seamless way to access protected features â€” like your personal playlists or account settings. 
How It Works 

    Uses the official local_auth  Flutter plugin.
    Supports Touch ID, Face ID, and Android fingerprint sensors.
    Ensures your data stays private and protected.
